# api.crystalprism.io
I started programming in January 2017 and am learning Python for back-end server development. api.crystalprism.io is the API for my website, [Crystal Prism](https://crystalprism.io). The API allows for the storage and retrieval of game scores, user-created drawings and thought posts, as well as user accounts. For user security, I implemented a JWT authentication flow from scratch that includes generating and verifying secure user tokens. To handle race conditions when writing to files, I implemented file locking operations with [`fcntl.flock`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/fcntl.html#fcntl.flock).

## Setup
To create your own copy of the Crystal Prism API, first clone this repository on your server. Next, install requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Set the following environment variables for the API:
* "SECRET_KEY" for the salt used to generate the signature portion of the JWT for user authentication (set this as a secret key that only you know; it is imperative to keep this private for user account protection)
* "ENV_TYPE" for the environment status (set this to "Dev" for testing or "Prod" for live)
* ["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"](http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/configuration.html#environment-variables) for the access key for your AWS account for accessing photos stored on an Amazon S3 bucket
* ["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"](http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/configuration.html#environment-variables) for the secret key for your AWS account
* "S3_BUCKET" for the name of your S3 bucket (e.g., 'crystalprism-photos')
* "PHOTO_URL_START" for the starting URL for photos in your S3 bucket (e.g., 'https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/crystalprism-photos/')

Start the server by running `flask run` (if you are making changes while the server is running, enter `flask run --reload` instead for instant updates).

## API Status
To check if the API is online, a client can send a request to the following endpoint.

**GET** /api/ping
* Retrieve a success message if the server is online. No bearer token is needed in the request Authorization header.
* Example response body:
```javascript
Success
```

## CanvaShare API
#### March 2017 - Present
[CanvaShare](https://crystalprism.io/canvashare/index.html) is a community drawing gallery that lets users create drawings and post them to a public gallery. Each user has a folder on the server for their drawings, as well as a folder for the drawing's attributes (title, number of likes, number of views, list of liked users). Drawings are stored as PNG files with numeric file names (*1.png*, *2.png*, etc.), and drawing information files are stored as JSON files with the same numeric file names (*1.json*, *2.json*, etc.).

**POST** /api/canvashare/drawing
